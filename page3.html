    <h2>New Teammates </h2>
<p>D'Amgelo Russell will be playing with a few new players he's never played with
like Brandon Ingram. They played a while duirng the summer league but still need
to play together more. D. Russell	J. Clarkson	L. Deng	J. Randle	T. Mozgov are going to be starters according to
<a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Los-Angeles-Lakers/13/Rosters">
this website.</a> D'Angelo was a starter for a lot of the games last season but this year
he is supposed to be the Lakers in-game leader. The new head coach Luke Walton says
that D'Angelo was practicing being an in-game leader during the summer league.  </p>
  <h2> D'Angelo's Thoughts On Coming Season</h2>
  <p>D'Angelo says he wants to get stronger to compete with other point guards in the
    league. He also thinks that the team were all trying to prove something individually.
    But he thinks that they can be more successful if they start to play as a team.
  D'Angelo is inspired by Kobe Bryant's work ethic and he wants to be able to work as
  hard as him. D'Angelo says he still feels like he has to prove that he can compete with
the rest of the players in the NBA and not just be average. </p>
